✅ 1️⃣ Linear Gradient
👉 Direction Properties:

to right (left → right)

to left (right → left)

to top (bottom → top)

to bottom (top → bottom)

to top right, to bottom left, etc.

👉 Inner Properties:

Multiple color stops (e.g. red 0%, blue 50%, green 100%)

Angle (e.g. 45deg, 90deg)

✅ 2️⃣ Radial Gradient
👉 Shape Properties:

circle

ellipse

👉 Position Properties:

at center (default)

at top, at bottom, at left, at right

at top left, at bottom right, etc.

👉 Inner Properties:

Size keywords: closest-side, closest-corner, farthest-side, farthest-corner

Multiple color stops

✅ 3️⃣ Conic Gradient
👉 Direction Properties:

from 0deg (starting angle)

from 90deg, from 180deg, etc.

👉 Position Properties:

at center (default)

at top, at left, etc.

👉 Inner Properties:

Multiple color stops around the circle (like a pie chart)

✅ 4️⃣ Diamond Gradient (variation of radial)
👉 Direction/Shape Properties:

Diamond shape radiating outward

Can be centered at center, at top, etc.

👉 Inner Properties:

Multiple color stops

Size can be controlled similarly to radial gradients

✅ 5️⃣ Reflected Gradient
👉 Direction Properties:

Usually linear with symmetry: to right, to left, to top, to bottom

👉 Inner Properties:

The gradient mirrors itself around the center

Uses multiple color stops in symmetric order
